# ROV-Python-Quizzes

## VSCode

Use [yapf](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/editing#_formatting) formatter with these settings in VSCode, for both the User Settings and the Workspace Settings.

```javascript
"python.formatting.yapfArgs": ["--style", "{based_on_style: chromium}"]
```

## Run the tests

Solve the problem within the quiz file and keep the main function name the same, then simply run the test checker for each quiz using this command: `python3 test_quiz[n].py`, just change the `n` to the number of the quiz.

Quiz 8 and 9 don't have tests, so you can freely name the methods and the variables. They will be evaluated manually.
